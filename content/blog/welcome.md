Catch us at [BOB2020](https://bobkonf.de/2020/en/) on the 28th February
2020 in Berlin where we will be [talking](https://bobkonf.de/2020/ennis-gies.html) about our usage of the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language to build high performance and high
density production systems with Tremor.
