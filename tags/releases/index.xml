Tremor has a powerful ETL language designed for flexibly pattern matching structured data such as JSON efficiently ( SIMD-accelerated ), and an easy to configure declarative flow-based SQL language designed for rich JSON like data to describe data processing and data flow graphs with declarative QoS constraints.</description></item></channel></rss>
